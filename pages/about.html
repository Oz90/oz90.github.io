      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Özgür Baserdem and I'm currently an aspiring full stack web developer. 
        Before I began the journey of learning how to code I studied political science at Stockholms Unversity 
        and worked within the public sector in Sweden which has been an amazing experience where I met lots of amazing people
        and learned a lot. However, during my paternal leave I had the time to reflect and think about where I really wanted to make a career.
        Basically I had two options: stay within my current field and make a career where I am "safe" and not really evolve professionally in a way 
        I want or change career into something I find exciting, fun and challenging. I've chosen the latter because I believe that it will make me 
        happier to do something I find meaningful and where I feel like I'm evolving professionally in a direction I want.
        Therefore I've taken my first serious steps into the world of web development by applying to Nackademin's 
        Full Stack Web Development programme which spans over 2 years where I'll learn programming both in theory and in practice. 
        But probably most important of all I'll get the chance to learn programming at a real workplace during my internship, which I am looking forward too!

      <h2>Nackademin</h2>
      <p>
        So currently, I am still taking my first steps of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer and I'm doing it at Nackademin. Nackademin is a higher vocational education school in Stockholm, Sweden.
        Nackademin was founded back in 1994 by two teachers who had an idea of starting an education that had a close collaboration and relation to the companies and industries it was 
        educating students for. They thought that this would benefit the companies as well as the students and I personally believe in this strongly and it is also the reason why I chose to study
        at Nackademin because I think that Nackademins long experience and their ties to the IT-industry is very valuable when it's time for me to do my internship.
