      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Özgür Baserdem and I'm currently an aspiring full stack web
        developer. Before I began the journey of learning how to code I studied
        political science at Stockholms Unversity and worked within the public
        sector in Sweden which has been an amazing experience where I met lots
        of amazing people and learned a lot. However, during my paternal leave I
        had the time to reflect and think about where I really wanted to make a
        career. Basically I had two options: stay within my current field and
        make a career where I am "safe" and not really evolve professionally in
        a way I want or change career into something I find exciting, fun and
        challenging. I've chosen the latter because I believe that it will make
        me happier to do something I find meaningful and where I feel like I'm
        evolving professionally in a direction I want. Therefore I've taken my
        first serious steps into the world of web development by applying to
        Nackademin's Full Stack Web Development programme which spans over 2
        years where I'll learn programming both in theory and in practice. But
        probably most important of all I'll get the chance to learn programming
        at a real workplace during my internship, which I am looking forward
        too!

      <h2>Nackademin</h2>
      <p>
        So currently, I am still taking my first steps of becoming a Full Stack
        Web Developer and I'm doing it at Nackademin. Nackademin is a higher
        vocational education school in Stockholm, Sweden. Nackademin was founded
        back in 1994 by two teachers who had an idea of starting an education
        that had a close collaboration and relation to the companies and
        industries it was educating students for. They thought that this would
        benefit the companies as well as the students and I personally believe
        in this strongly and it is also the reason why I chose to study at
        Nackademin because I think that Nackademins long experience and their
        ties to the IT-industry is very valuable when it's time for me to do my
        internship.

      <h2>Full Stack Web Development</h2>
      <p>
        At Nackademin I am currently in the Full Stack Open Source Web Developer
        programme which I chose because I wanted to learn both the front-end and
        back-end parts of web development. I believe that this gives me an edge
        in my career as I'll be able to understand large parts of the
        development process and hopefully be able to adjust accordingly
        depending on what is needed in the teams I work. I'll things like
        NodeJS, PHP, JavaScript, React, HMTL, CSS and SQL. This basically means
        that I'll have knowledge in how to program a browser (JavaScript),
        program a server (NodeJS) and program a database (SQL). I hope that my
        broad range of qualities will give me a great understanding of the
        different parts of web development as well as give me the possibility to
        help other team members, as well as understand them better. I am very
        much looking forward to putting my skills to work during my first
        internship starting in the fall of 2021.
